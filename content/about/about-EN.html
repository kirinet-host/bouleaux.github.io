        <p>I'm very happy you've found your way here, dear visitor! </p>
        <p>Like many others, I've lately become quite disillusioned with the current state of the Internet, and this website is part of my ongoing attempt at going back to the basics and turning my online experience into something that actually brings me joy.</p>
        <p>I believe in the hand-crafted, the curated, the personal. Though my artistic skills may be lacking, I hope to be able to express myself through this site and really turn it into my own personal corner of the Internet.</p>
        <p>With that said, please do enjoy your time here! If you wish to contact me, you can send me an e-mail at:</p>
        <p><a href="mailto:contact@kirinet.eu" style=color:darkred>contact@kirinet.eu</a></p>
        <p>My site has content in three languages: Finnish, English and French. Not everything will be available in all three, but I'll try to provide a summary in English for most things.</p>

        <h3>More about me:</h3>
        <p>I currently live in Helsinki, Finland. </p>
        <p style=background-color:bisque>* <i>Why <strong>"Bouleaux?"</strong></i></p>
        <p>My childhood home in the suburbs of Brussels was on Avenue des Bouleaux, <i>the birch trees</i>, and the name has stuck with me ever since.</p>
        <p>Since the street was actually located in Flanders (the border of the Brussels Capital Region at both ends), the sign has it first in Dutch, then French. </p>
