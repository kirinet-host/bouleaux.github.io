        <p>I'm very happy you've found your way here, dear visitor! </p>
        <p>Like many others, I've lately become quite disillusioned with the current state of the Internet, and this website is part of my ongoing attempt at going back to the basics and turning my online experience into something that actually brings me joy.</p>
        <p>I believe in the hand-crafted, the curated, the personal. Though my artistic skills may be lacking, I hope to be able to express myself through this site and really turn it into my own personal corner of the Internet.</p>
        <p>With that said, please do enjoy your time here! If you wish to contact me, you can send me an e-mail at:</p>
        <p><a href="mailto:contact@kirinet.eu" style=color:darkred>contact@kirinet.eu</a></p>
        <p>My site has content in three languages: Finnish, English and French. Not everything will be available in all three, but I'll try to provide a summary in English for most things.</p>

        <p style=background-color:bisque>* <i>Why <strong>"Bouleaux?"</strong></i></p>
        <p>My childhood home in Brussels was on Avenue des Bouleaux, <i>the birch trees</i>, and the name has stuck with me.</p>
        <p style=background-color:bisque>* <i>My favourite ice-cream flavour?</i></p>
        <p>Strawberry. To my great chagrin, my favourite ice-cream of all is Häagen-Dazs strawberries & cream. I'm slightly annoyed that an American brand seems to be trying to appear exotic by using a nonsensical pseudo-Scandinavian name, but my bigger grievance is with their exorbitant pricing and the fact that for some reason - FOR SOME REASON - they decided to completely pull strawberries & cream from the Finnish market...</p>
