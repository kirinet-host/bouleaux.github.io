        <p> Now this is what an adventure is! Not nearly as obscure as I thought it would be or as I was told, the original The Legend of Zelda was revolutionary for it's time and still feels that way today. The world is mysterious and full of wonder; it's truly incredible how immersive a measly 8 bits can be! I drew myself a paper map and went on my merry way with the trusty manual as my only guide. Sublime is the word. This icon of video games takes up less space than a single jpeg.</p>
        <h3>Have I beaten it?</h3>
        <p>Yes, in 2023. I have yet to play the second quest, but probably will at some point.</p>

        <p>So much pain, but I finally did it. My history with E.V.O. goes way back: for some reason I had a SNES emulator disc on PS2 as a kid (probably bought by my father on a work trip in Southeast Asia), but there were only a handful of games that piqued my interest enough to play them. E.V.O. was one of the few, and it left a lasting impact on me - even though I could never make it past the fish stage! I remember even making my own rudimentary version of it in Game Maker at some point, there was something about it that instantly hooked me from the very moment I saw the title screen.</p>
        <p>There is something mysterious, even ritualistic about this game. There's something beautiful about it at times, though maybe even unintentionally quite nihilistic and, truth be told, really quite silly as well. Some of the music is good, especially at the beginning, but the most played tracks post-fish get extremely annoying and give a weird tone to game. The mysterious atmosphere really takes a nosedive later on.</p>
        <p>I usually try to avoid relying on guides, but I really couldn't do without them this time. If the exploit of evolving to get your health back is not an intended mechanic, I really have no clue how anyone but the most hardcore of players is expected to beat this game. The bosses can be truly insane, unfortunately a lot of the time in the "your double tap didn't quite register so here's a two hit K.O." kind of way. But then sometimes just by random luck you can back them into a corner and cheese them in an instant. Even though I quite dislike using them, I had to put a save state right before the Yeti Mother just to be able to skip going back to the title screen every time I got annihilated. The constant resetting after only surviving for seconds at a time was driving me insane. You can't really learn the patterns when you don't even have time to register what's going on. And I don't know for sure, but some of the bosses seemed to be able to randomly change pattern or direction mid-move. So tough luck with that.</p>
        <p>In the end, I don't know if E.V.O. quite lived up to my childhood dreams, but I'm happy to have finally seen the end.</p>
        <h3>Have I beaten it?</h3>
        <p>Yes, in 2025.</p>
